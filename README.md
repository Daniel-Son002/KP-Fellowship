## Personal Statement 1:
I would like to have the opportunity to create something to help people, whether it has some small use that is helpful once in a while or itâ€™s a daily use item. Making a positive technological impact on society is rewarding as a creative engineer because it is proof of courageousness to try something new and devotion to keep working which are key qualities in an engineer and inventor. In addition, I would at least want to make a positive impact on the people around me. While it is hopeful to make an impact for the greater good of the world, it is more feasible to make a positive impact for the ones around you. 

## Personal Statement 2:
My most meaningful academic experience was doing robotics research this past Summer at React Lab at Harvard. While very recent, this experience gave me insight on what I may want to do in the future. I have not been able to explore many of the different facets of computer science because of my relatively little experience; however, this academic opportunity allowed me to gauge the academic research aspect of robotics within the field of computer science. This project was the first research paper that I have formally written during my time at Harvard and it was beneficial for me to be surrounded by people so experienced in researching and robotics. Being surrounded by mentors guiding me through the background research, problem development, and experimentation really helped me learn the process. Furthermore, this project not only helped me hone my theoretical understanding but also helped me learn new languages for the purposes of optimization and robotics specific integration.
